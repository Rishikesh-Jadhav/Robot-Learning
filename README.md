# Robot-Learning
This repository serves as a record of my academic experience in ENPM690 during the Spring of 2024. It includes my code submissions for projects and assignments. Each assignment is organized within its respective folder, complete with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview
This course offers a comprehensive exploration of the intersection between machine learning and robotics, aimed at enhancing the capabilities of robotic systems. The course is structured into several modules, each addressing fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in robot learning:

1. **Foundations of Robot Learning:** Introduction to machine learning paradigms applicable to robotics, including Reinforcement Learning, Learning from Demonstration, and Robot Shaping. Discussion on the importance of adaptation and learning for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments.

2. **Learning Techniques and Paradigms:** Examination of various machine learning paradigms such as CMAC, KNN, MLP, lazy learning, LWR, RBF, and deep networks. Exploration of how these techniques generate models that enable robots to perform tasks efficiently.

3. **Integration with Robotic Control:** Integration of machine learning techniques with traditional robotic control approaches such as motor schema, behavior-based, and direct and inverse methods. Emphasis on creating controllers capable of operating robots effectively in real-world environments.

4. **Advanced Applications:** Application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and deep networks, to extend the capabilities of robotic systems. Discussion on useful representations and model building techniques for nonstationary robotic systems.

By the end of the course, it is expected for me to be able to design and implement machine learning solutions for robotics applications.
